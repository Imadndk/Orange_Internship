## Notebook Descriptions

1. **EDA and Model Selection**:
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and evaluation of various models for:
     - **Blood Pressure Prediction**
     - **Respiratory Rate Prediction**

2. **Model Deployment**:
   - Step-by-step deployment of the selected models (Blood Pressure and Respiratory Rate) using:
     - **AWS SageMaker**
     - **Docker**

3. **LSTM Model**:
   - Development of the **LSTM multiclassification model** to predict urgent medical cases in advance real-time, based on IoT device data.

## Usage

1. Open the `.ipynb` files using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Follow the instructions within each notebook for running the cells and understanding the workflow.
3. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`requirements.txt` file provided in the main project).
